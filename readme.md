## API Usage Examples

### Add an Expense with Custom Splits
```bash
POST /expenses
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 1000.00,
  "description": "Dinner at restaurant",
  "paid_by": "Shantanu",
  "category": "Food",
  "splits": [
    {
      "person_name": "Shantanu",
      "split_type": "percentage",
      "split_value": 50
    },
    {
      "person_name": "Sanket", 
      "split_type": "exact",
      "split_value": 300
    },
    {
      "person_name": "Om",
      "split_type": "equal"
    },
    {
      "person_name": "Priya",
      "split_type": "equal"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Split Types:**
- **`equal`**: Split remaining amount equally among equal participants
- **`percentage`**: Specify percentage of total (1-100)
- **`exact`**: Specify exact amount in currency

**How it works:**
1. **Exact amounts** are allocated first (Sanket pays ‚Çπ300)
2. **Percentage amounts** are calculated next (Shantanu pays 50% = ‚Çπ500)
3. **Equal splits** share the remaining amount (Om & Priya split ‚Çπ200 = ‚Çπ100 each)

### Add Simple Equal Split Expense
```bash
POST /expenses
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 60.00,
  "description": "Coffee",
  "paid_by": "Shantanu",
  "category": "Food"
}
```
*If no splits provided, automatically creates equal split among all existing people*

### Create Recurring Transaction
```bash
POST /recurring
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 15000.00,
  "description": "Monthly Rent",
  "paid_by": "Shantanu",
  "category": "Utilities",
  "recurrence_type": "monthly",
  "start_date": "2024-01-01T00:00:00",
  "end_date": "2025-12-31T23:59:59"
}
```

    "categories": [
      {
        "category": "Food",
        "amount": 1330.0,
        "percentage": 31.25,
        "count": 3
      },
      {
        "category": "Utilities", 
        "amount": 2000.0,
        "percentage": 46.99,
        "count": 2
      }
    ],
    "total_amount": 4260.0,
    "total_expenses": 7
  }
}
```

## Deployment

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string (defaults to SQLite for local development)

### Recommended Deployment Platforms
- **Railway.app** (Recommended)
- **Render.com**
- **Heroku**

### Deployment Steps for Railway
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
2. Set environment variables if needed
3. Railway will automatically detect the Python app and deploy

### For Production Database
Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL by setting the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
```

## üßÆ Settlement Calculation Logic

The expense splitter uses an intelligent algorithm to minimize the number of transactions needed to settle all debts.

### How Settlement Calculation Works

#### Step 1: Calculate Individual Balances
For each person, the system calculates:
- **Amount Paid**: Total of all expenses they paid for
- **Amount Owed**: Sum of their calculated shares from all expense splits
- **Net Balance**: `Amount Paid - Amount Owed`
  - **Positive balance**: Person is owed money
  - **Negative balance**: Person owes money
  - **Zero balance**: Person is settled

#### Step 2: Split Types and Calculation Priority
When processing expense splits, the system handles different split types in this order:

1. **Exact Amounts** (`"split_type": "exact"`): Fixed currency amounts allocated first
2. **Percentage Splits** (`"split_type": "percentage"`): Calculated as percentage of total expense
3. **Equal Splits** (`"split_type": "equal"`): Remaining amount divided equally among equal participants

**Example Calculation:**
```
Expense: ‚Çπ1000 "Team Dinner"
Splits:
- Shantanu: 40% = ‚Çπ400
- Sanket: Exact ‚Çπ300 = ‚Çπ300  
- Om: Equal = ‚Çπ150 (‚Çπ300 remaining √∑ 2)
- Priya: Equal = ‚Çπ150 (‚Çπ300 remaining √∑ 2)
Total: ‚Çπ400 + ‚Çπ300 + ‚Çπ150 + ‚Çπ150 = ‚Çπ1000 ‚úì
```

#### Step 3: Settlement Optimization Algorithm
The system uses a greedy algorithm to minimize transactions:

1. **Separate Debtors and Creditors**: 
   - Debtors: People with negative balances (owe money)
   - Creditors: People with positive balances (are owed money)

2. **Match Optimal Pairs**: 
   - For each debtor, find the creditor who can receive the most money
   - Calculate settlement amount as `min(debtor_owes, creditor_owed)`
   - Create settlement transaction

3. **Update Remaining Balances**: Continue until all balances are zero

**Example Settlement:**
```
Before Settlement:
- Shantanu: +‚Çπ500 (owed)
- Sanket: -‚Çπ200 (owes) 
- Om: -‚Çπ300 (owes)

Optimized Settlements:
1. Om pays Shantanu ‚Çπ300
2. Sanket pays Shantanu ‚Çπ200

Result: Everyone settled with just 2 transactions
(Instead of potentially 3+ transactions in a naive approach)
```

### Mathematical Properties

- **Conservation**: Total amount paid always equals total amount owed
- **Minimality**: Algorithm produces the minimum number of settlement transactions
- **Accuracy**: Uses Decimal arithmetic to avoid floating-point precision errors
- **Completeness**: Guarantees all debts are settled when algorithm completes

### Edge Cases Handled

1. **Empty Database**: Returns empty balances and settlements
2. **Single Person**: No settlements needed
3. **Already Settled**: Returns empty settlement list
4. **Rounding**: Small differences (< ‚Çπ0.01) are handled gracefully
5. **Mixed Split Types**: Properly validates and calculates complex scenarios

## üöÄ Known Limitations and Assumptions

### Current Limitations

1. **Single Currency**: Only supports one currency (‚Çπ INR in examples)
2. **No User Authentication**: No login system or user access control
3. **Basic Web Interface**: Simple dashboard without advanced UI features
4. **No File Uploads**: Cannot attach receipts or images to expenses
5. **Timezone Handling**: All dates stored in UTC, no timezone conversion
6. **No Audit Trail**: Changes to expenses don't maintain history
7. **Memory-based Processing**: Recurring transactions processed on-demand

### Assumptions Made

1. **Trust-based System**: Assumes honest reporting of expenses
2. **Equal Default**: When no splits specified, assumes equal division among all people
3. **Name-based Identity**: People identified by name only (case-sensitive)
4. **Positive Amounts**: All expenses and splits must be positive values
5. **Immediate Settlement**: Assumes settlements happen immediately when calculated
6. **Decimal Precision**: Uses 2 decimal places for currency calculations
7. **Linear Recurrence**: Recurring transactions follow simple time patterns

### Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Multi-currency Support**: Currency conversion and international splitting
2. **User Authentication**: Secure login and user management
3. **Advanced Web UI**: Rich interface with charts, graphs, and better UX
4. **Mobile App**: Native mobile applications for iOS/Android
5. **Receipt Management**: Photo upload and OCR for automatic expense entry
6. **Export Features**: PDF reports, Excel exports, accounting software integration
7. **Notification System**: Email/SMS alerts for settlements and reminders
8. **Group Management**: Multiple expense groups with different participants
9. **Payment Integration**: Direct integration with payment apps (UPI, PayPal, etc.)
10. **Advanced Analytics**: Trends, predictions, budget tracking, and insights

### Technical Debt

1. **Error Handling**: Could be more granular with specific error codes
2. **Performance**: No caching or query optimization for large datasets
3. **Testing**: Lacks comprehensive unit and integration tests
4. **Documentation**: API documentation could be auto-generated (OpenAPI/Swagger)
5. **Logging**: Basic logging, could be enhanced for production monitoring
6. **Security**: No rate limiting, input sanitization, or SQL injection protection

### Example
If three people have these balances:
- Shantanu: +‚Çπ390 (owed money)
- Sanket: -‚Çπ123.33 (owes money)  
- Om: -‚Çπ266.67 (owes money)

The algorithm generates:
- Om pays Shantanu ‚Çπ266.67
- Sanket pays Shantanu ‚Çπ123.33

This settles all debts with just 2 transactions instead of potentially more complex arrangements.

## Error Handling

The API includes comprehensive error handling:

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input data
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: Invalid HTTP method
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server errors

All errors return consistent JSON format:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description",
  "errors": ["Detailed error messages"]
}
```

## Data Validation

- **Amount**: Must be positive number
- **Description**: Required, non-empty string
- **Paid By**: Required, non-empty string
- **Person Names**: Automatically trimmed and validated
